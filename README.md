## Introduction

This tutorial is intended to give you an overview of the workflow commonly employed for data generated by parallel DNA sequencing.  Specifically, we will examine data from data from the coding regions of genome, i.e. the exome.  The initial steps of the process are computationally intensive and require some time to be executed so they will be described. But the final steps â€“ annotation and analysis can be done in R.


## Aligning Sequence Data
The file we receive following sequencing is known as a fastq, it typically consists of millions of lines but each sequening read is encoded by four lines
